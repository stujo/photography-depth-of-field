What's In Focus : Samples
==========

# f2.8 - Wide Aperture
![f2.8 - Widest Aperture](./samples/2015-curious-9689-f2.8.jpg)
We can see Curious George, but the pumpkin and the elephant are out of focus, the stacking Tower is a little soft, but might be acceptable. The building is very blurry as is everything in the distance.
 
# f5.6 - Wide Aperture

The Stacking Tower is now clearly in focus

# f13 - Narrow Aperture

Except for the dog cartoon the table contents are nicely in focus

# f22 - Very Small Aperture

Everything on the table is sharply focused. The road sign and the bridge in the background are reasonably visible on this cloudy day.

What do you think had to change for each exposure of this sequence so that the picture remains bright as the aperture gets smaller?
